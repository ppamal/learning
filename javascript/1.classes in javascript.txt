// if we want to design a graphic, eg:like a moving object,we need to be familiar with the concept of objects and classes in js.
i want to make it work like an object with functionalities.

in that case we can say 
cat.eat()
car.move()
where cat is an object

class is a template or a blueprint

its like a `bubble` where we can encapsulate data and the methods 

`new` is the keyword to create an object from the class

In JavaScript, constructor functions are conventionally capitalized to indicate that they should be used with the new keyword to create objects.
